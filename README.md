# QuickSort project
This repositiry contains my implementation of QuickSort based on the Hoare's algorithm. This is my way of splitting the array into three parts: values that less than pivot, values that equal to pivot, values that greater than pivot. During splitting, unnecessary swaps are avoided, which makes my algorithm adaptive.
